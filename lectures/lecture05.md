```
• Mhy cant LUM spell well? 
• Why cant LLM do super string processing like inverting a string?
• Why are LLMs bad at simple arithmetic? 
• Why dd GPT-2 have more trouble with coding in Python 2? 
• Why did my LLM abruptly halt when it sees "<endoftext>"? 
• What is this weird warnirg about "trailing whitespace"? 
• Why woul I prefer to use YAML over JSON win LLMs? T
• What is the root of my LLM suffering?
